# Java Grep App

## Introduction
This app recursively searches for a text pattern in a given directory, and outputs matched lines to a file.
The app takes in three arguments: 
`USAGE: regex rootPath outFile`

Similar to
`egrep -r {regex} {rootPath} > {outFile}`

> regex - a special text string for describing a search pattern

> rootPath - root directory path

> outFile - output file name
